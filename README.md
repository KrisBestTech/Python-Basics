Python projects, calculations and exercises.
<br/>
<br/>
Each folder contains Word files with all the **_Problem Descriptions_**  (_at the top of each folder_) and their solutions coded in **_Python_**.
Some of the problems and exercises are more difficult than others and are therefore marked with **'#'**.
<br/>
<br/>
_'#' - Slightly more difficult.
<br/>
<br/>
'##' - Moderate difficulty.
<br/>
<br/>
'###' - The most advanced in the course._
